# Platypus OS Desktop
The desktop for Platypus OS. Because Platypus OS is a totally new thing (Ok, maybe not totally, there are some, actually, a lot of files from the Linux kernel), it has an (almost) totally new kernel, and this is the desktop OS. This is where it all goes. NOTE, ***THIS IS IN ALPHA STAGE. IF IT CRASHES, IT'S NOT MY FAULT. THANK YOU GNU PROJECT FOR PUTTING THAT IN YOUR LICENSE***
## How to get around
I realized that I have nothing here about how to get around. So, here we go:
***
### The `.github` folder
That's my code scanning thing and Dependabot thing
### The `command lines` folder
That is where everything relating to the command lines goes
#### The `platypusPrompt `folder
That is where the command line for logging in, and other stuff goes, it is in another repository.
#### The `bash` folder
That is where I am (slowly but steadily) putting in the code from the bash shell.
### The `Desktop tools` folder
This is where the desktop environment goes, if I could only upload a folder.
### The `internet-stuff` folder
This is where internet stuff goes.
### The `security` folder
This is really important. That is where everything security related goes.
### The `docs` folder
This is where the GH Pages site is being hosted from, for this fork.

## Contributing
Contributing is covered in most other repositories, it applies to this. Thank you!
## This used to be the kernel! What happened?
This was the kernel, then I decided I would make this the desktop, and then the kernel repository would come along later, once this was fully developed.
## This has a lot if GNU. When this is deployed, will it just be called "Platypus OS" or "GNU/Platypus OS"?
GNU/Platypus OS to avoid controversy.
